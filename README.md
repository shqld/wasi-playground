# WASI Playground

A personal playground for [WASI (The WebAssembly System Interface)](https://wasi.dev/).

Ensure the following:

    * to build, you have run `rustup target add wasm32-wasi` before.
    * to run, you have run `brew install wasmtime` before.

### Benchmark

```sh
$ make benchmark
```
